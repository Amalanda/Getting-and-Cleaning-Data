# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Course Project

The objective of the Cours Project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## About the Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Repository

This repository contains 4 files with the following information:

1. *run_analysis.R*: The script with the analysis performed.
2. *Tidy_Data_Set.txt*: The data set with the result from the analysis performed.
3. *CodeBook.md*: A text file which indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?
4. *README.md*: The present document explains what the analysis files did.
